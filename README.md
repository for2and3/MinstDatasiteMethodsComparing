Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different data preprocessing methods and machine learning algorithms in an EMNIST handwritten digital image dataset

##### GOAL
Our objective is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different data preprocessing methods and machine learning algorithms in an EMNIST handwritten digital image dataset of 28x28 pixel, and select the most suitable preprocessing method and classifier. This project choosed three preprocessing methods which are Standard, Normalized, Cropping, and selected four models of KNN, Logistic Regression, MLP, and CNN for research.

#### Result
##### Accuracy of Pre-processing
